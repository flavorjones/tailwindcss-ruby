## v3.4.13 / 2023-09-26

* This gem was extracted from `tailwindcss-rails`.

  In advance of the upcoming TailwindCSS v4 release, we are decoupling the `tailwindcss` executable
  from the Rails integration. This will allow users to upgrade TailwindCSS at a time of their
  choosing, and allow early adopters to start using the beta releases.

  It should also make it easier for non-Rails Ruby projects to use tailwindcss (e.g., Jekyll and
  other web frameworks).
