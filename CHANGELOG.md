## [Unreleased]

## v3.4.15

* Update `tailwindcss` to [v3.4.15](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.4.15). (#19) @flavorjones


## v3.4.14

* Update `tailwindcss` to [v3.4.14](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.4.14). (#8) @flavorjones


## v3.4.13 / 2023-09-26

* This gem was extracted from `tailwindcss-rails`.

  In advance of the upcoming TailwindCSS v4 release, we are decoupling the `tailwindcss` executable
  from the Rails integration. This will allow users to upgrade TailwindCSS at a time of their
  choosing, and allow early adopters to start using the beta releases.

  It should also make it easier for non-Rails Ruby projects to use tailwindcss (e.g., Jekyll and
  other web frameworks).
